# Cursus 42

This repository contains my solutions for the projects of the 42 cursus in MÃ¡laga. Below is a brief description of each project.

## Project Index

1. [libft](#libft)
2. [ft_printf](#ft_printf)
3. [get_next_line](#get_next_line)
4. [Born2BeRoot](#born2beroot)
5. [Pipex](#pipex)
6. [Minitalk](#minitalk)
7. [Push_swap](#push_swap)

### libft

`libft` is a project where I recreated some of the most commonly used functions from the C standard library, `libc`. This custom library has been a foundational tool for many of my subsequent projects in 42.

### ft_printf

`ft_printf` is a recreation of the famous C function `printf`. The main objective here is to learn about variadic functions in C and how to handle different types of formats and arguments.

### get_next_line

`get_next_line` is a function that reads a line from a file descriptor. It's useful for reading user input or processing files line by line.

### Born2BeRoot

`Born2BeRoot` is a system administration project. Here, I set up a virtual machine with specific security specs and configurations.

### Pipex

`Pipex` simulates the behavior of the shell in terms of pipes and redirections. It's a simple representation of how `pipe` and `dup2` are used in systems programming.

### Minitalk

`Minitalk` is a program that uses UNIX signals to communicate between a server and a client. It's an introduction to programming with signals in C.

### Push_swap

`Push_swap` is an algorithms project. The goal is to sort a stack of numbers using the least number of operations and two auxiliary stacks.

I hope this repository is helpful for future students or anyone interested in C programming and systems concepts. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out.
