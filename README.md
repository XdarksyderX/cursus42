# 42 School Projects by me :)

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my projects developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. These projects cover a range of topics from system programming to graphical projects and algorithms.

## Projects
### [Libft](https://github.com/xdarksyderx/libft)
Custom C library that replicates the functionality of various standard C library functions and adds additional utility functions.

### [ft_printf](https://github.com/xdarksyderx/ft_printf)
A reimplementation of the `printf` function in C, handling multiple format specifiers and custom conversions.

### [Push_swap](https://github.com/xdarksyderx/push_swap)
An algorithmic challenge to sort data on a stack using a limited set of operations in as few moves as possible.

### [Pipex](https://github.com/xdarksyderx/pipex)
Mimics the behavior of shell pipelines in Unix, using file descriptors and process management.

### [So_Long](https://github.com/xdarksyderx/so_long)
A 2D video game, focusing on graphical programming and 2D rendering using the MiniLibX library.

### [Minitalk](https://github.com/xdarksyderx/minitalk)
A communication program in the form of a client and server, demonstrating UNIX signals and inter-process communication.

## Skills Developed
- Deep understanding of C programming and system-level operations.
- Familiarity with Unix/Linux environments and their system calls.
- Hands-on experience with low-level graphical libraries (e.g., MiniLibX).
- Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
